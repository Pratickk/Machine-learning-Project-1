Machine Learning with Logistic Regression

In this project we will work with a fake advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an advertisement.

I will create a logistic regression model that will predict whether or not a user will click on an ad, based on his/her features. As this is a binary classification problem, a logistic regression model is well suited here.
